      <p>
        I began my career creating prototypes for a couple of hardware projects,
        which involved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>drawing schematics and PCBs</li>
        <li>
          programming firmware for microcontrollers to monitor sensors and
          control actuators
        </li>
        <li>
          baking tweaked kernels and cross-compiling applications for embedded
          devices
        </li>
        <li>making everything communicate through protocols</li>
        <li>adding a bit of depth sensors and computer vision to the mix</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};

export default ExperienceHardware;
